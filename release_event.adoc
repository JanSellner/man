[[description]]
== Description

Decrements the event reference count.
The event object is deleted once the event reference count is zero, the specific command identified by this event has completed (or terminated) and there are no commands in any device command queue that require a wait for this event to complete.

`event` must be an event returned by <<enqueue_kernel.adoc#, `enqueue_kernel`>> or <<enqueue_marker.adoc#, `enqueue_marker`>> or a user event.
