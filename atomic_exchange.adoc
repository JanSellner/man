[[description]]
== Description

Atomically replace the value pointed to by `object` with `desired`.
Memory is affected according to the value of `order`.
These operations are read-modify-write operations (as defined by section 5.1.2.4 of the C11 specification).
Atomically returns the value pointed to by `object` immediately before the effects.
