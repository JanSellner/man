[[clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects]]
= clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects

Acquire OpenCL memory objects that have been created from OpenGL objects.

[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`command_queue`::

A valid command-queue.
All devices used to create the OpenCL context associated with `command_queue` must support acquiring shared CL/GL objects.
This constraint is enforced at context creation time.

`num_objects`::

The number of memory objects to be acquired in `mem_objects`.

`mem_objects`::

A pointer to a list of CL memory objects that correspond to GL objects.

`event_wait_list` `num_events_in_wait_list`::

Specify events that need to complete before this particular command can be executed.
If `event_wait_list` is NULL, then this particular command does not wait on any event to complete.
If `event_wait_list` is NULL, `num_events_in_wait_list` must be 0.
If `event_wait_list` is not NULL, the list of events pointed to by `event_wait_list` must be valid and `num_events_in_wait_list` must be greater than 0.
The events specified in `event_wait_list` act as synchronization points.

`event`::

+
--

Returns an event object that identifies this command and can be used to query or queue a wait for the command to complete.
`event` can be NULL in which case it will not be possible for the application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this command to complete.
If the `event_wait_list` and the `event` arguments are not NULL, the `event` argument should not refer to an element of the `event_wait_list` array.

If the <<cl_khr_gl_event.adoc#, `cl_khr_gl_event`>> extension is supported, if an OpenGL context is bound to the current thread, then any OpenGL commands which

* affect or access the contents of a memory object listed in the `mem_objects` list, and

* were issued on that OpenGL context prior to the call to `clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects`

will complete before execution of any OpenCL commands following the `clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects` which affect or access any of those memory objects.
If a non-NULL event object is returned, it will report completion only after completion of such OpenGL commands.

If the <<cl_khr_egl_event.adoc#, `cl_khr_egl_event`>> extension is supported, prior to calling `clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects`, the application must ensure that any pending EGL or EGL client API operations which access the objects specified in `mem_objects` have completed.

[[description]]
== Description

These objects need to be acquired before they can be used by any OpenCL commands queued to a command-queue.
The OpenGL objects are acquired by the OpenCL context associated with `command_queue` and can therefore be used by all command-queues associated with the OpenCL context.

[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
If `num_objects` is 0 and `mem_objects` is NULL the function does nothing and returns `CL_SUCCESS`.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `num_objects` is zero and `mem_objects` is not a NULL value or if `num_objects` > 0 and `mem_objects` is NULL.

* `CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT` if memory objects in `mem_objects` are not valid OpenCL memory objects.

* `CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE` if `command_queue` is not a valid command-queue.

* `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if context associated with `command_queue` was not created from an OpenGL context.

* `CL_INVALID_GL_OBJECT` if memory objects in `mem_objects` have not been created from a GL object(s).

* `CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST` if `event_wait_list` is NULL and `num_events_in_wait_list` > 0, or `event_wait_list` is not NULL and `num_events_in_wait_list` is 0, or if event objects in `event_wait_list` are not valid events.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
