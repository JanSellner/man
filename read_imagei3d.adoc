[[description]]
== Description

`aQual` refers to one of the access qualifiers `read_only`, `write_only`, or `read_write`.
For samplerless read functions this may be `read_only` or `read_write`.

The forms that take a `sampler_t` use the coordinate _(coord.x, coord.y, coord.z)_ to do an element lookup in the 3D image object specified by `image`.
`coord.w` is ignored.

For the forms that take a `sampler_t` and which are enabled by the <<cl_khr_mipmap_image.adoc#, `cl_khr_mipmap_image`>> extension, use the coordinate _coord.xyz_ to do an element lookup in the mip-level specified by `lod` in the 3D image object specified by `image`.

The samplerless read image functions behave exactly as the corresponding read image functions that take integer coordinates and a sampler with filter mode set to `CLK_FILTER_NEAREST`, normalized coordinates set to `CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE` and addressing mode to `CLK_ADDRESS_NONE`.

`read_imagei` and `read_imageui` return unnormalized signed integer and unsigned integer values respectively.
Each channel will be stored in a 32-bit integer.

`read_imagei` can only be used with image objects created with `image_channel_data_type` set to one of the following values: `CL_SIGNED_INT8`, `CL_SIGNED_INT16`, or `CL_SIGNED_INT32`.
If the `image_channel_data_type` is not one of the above values, the values returned by `read_imagei` are undefined.

`read_imageui` can only be used with image objects created with `image_channel_data_type` set to one of the following values: `CL_UNSIGNED_INT8`, `CL_UNSIGNED_INT16`, and `CL_UNSIGNED_INT32`.
If the `image_channel_data_type` is not one of the above values, the values returned by `read_imageui` are undefined.

The `read_image{i|ui}` calls support a nearest filter only.
The filter_mode specified in `sampler` must be set to `CLK_FILTER_NEAREST`; otherwise the values returned are undefined.

Furthermore, the `read_image{i|ui}` calls that take integer coordinates must use a sampler with normalized coordinates set to `CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE` and addressing mode set to `CLK_ADDRESS_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, `CLK_ADDRESS_CLAMP` or `CLK_ADDRESS_NONE`; otherwise the values returned are undefined.

.Mipmap read image functions:

`CL_SAMPLER_NORMALIZED_COORDS` must be `CL_TRUE` for built-in functions described in the table above that read from a mip-mapped image; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
The value specified in the `lod` argument is clamped to the minimum of (actual number of mip-levels â€“ 1) in the image or value specified for `CL_SAMPLER_LOD_MAX`.
