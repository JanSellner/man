[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`platform`::

The platform ID returned by <<clGetPlatformIDs.adoc#, `clGetPlatformIDs`>> or can be NULL.
If `platform` is NULL, the behavior is implementation-defined.

`param_name`::

An enumeration constant that identifies the platform information being queried.
It can be one of the values specified in the table below.

`param_value`::

A pointer to memory location where appropriate values for a given `param_name` will be returned.
Possible `param_value` values returned are listed in the table below.
If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`::

Specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size in bytes must be â‰¥ size of return type specified in the table below.

`param_value_size_ret`::

Returns the actual size in bytes of data being queried by `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored

.OpenCL Platform Queries

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|cl_platform_info
|Return Type
|Description

|`CL_PLATFORM_PROFILE`
|char[]
|

OpenCL profile string.
Returns the profile name supported by the implementation.
The profile name returned can be one of the following strings:

FULL_PROFILE - if the implementation supports the OpenCL specification (functionality defined as part of the core specification and does not require any extensions to be supported).

EMBEDDED_PROFILE - if the implementation supports the OpenCL embedded profile.
The embedded profile is defined to be a subset for each version of OpenCL.
The embedded profile for OpenCL 2.1 is described in section 7.

|`CL_PLATFORM_VERSION`
|char[]
|

OpenCL version string.
Returns the OpenCL version supported by the implementation.
This version string has the following format:

`OpenCL<space><major_version.minor_version><space><platform-specific information>`

The `major_version.minor_version` value returned will be 2.1.

|`CL_PLATFORM_NAME`
|char[]
|Platform name string.

|`CL_PLATFORM_VENDOR`
|char[]
|Platform vendor string.

|`CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS`
|char[]
|

Returns a space-separated list of extension names (the extension names themselves do not contain any spaces) supported by the platform.
Extensions defined here must be supported by all devices associated with this platform.

|`CL_PLATFORM_HOST_TIMER_RESOLUTION`
|cl_ulong
|

Returns the resolution of the host timer in nanoseconds as used by <<clGetDeviceAndHostTimer.adoc#, `clGetDeviceAndHostTimer`>>.

|`CL_PLATFORM_ICD_SUFFIX_KHR`
|char[]
|

If the <<cl_khr_icd.adoc#, `cl_khr_icd`>> extension is enabled, the function name suffix used to identify extension functions to be directed to this platform by the ICD Loader.

[[notes]]
== Notes

A null terminated string is returned by OpenCL query function calls if the return type of the information being queried is a char[].


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns the following: (The OpenCL specification does not describe the order of precedence for error codes returned by API calls)

* `CL_INVALID_PLATFORM` if `platform` is not a valid platform.

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not one of the supported values or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is less than size of return type and `param_value` is not a NULL value.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
