[[description]]
== Description

`aQual` refers to one of the access qualifiers `read_only`, `write_only`, or `read_write`.
For samplerless read functions this may be `read_only` or `read_write`.

For the forms that take an `image3d_t`, use the coordinate _(coord.x, coord.y, coord.z)_ to do an element lookup in the 3D image object specified by `image`. _coord.w_ is ignored.

The samplerless read image functions behave exactly as the corresponding read image functions that take integer coordinates and a sampler with filter mode set to `CLK_FILTER_NEAREST`, normalized coordinates set to `CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE` and addressing mode to `CLK_ADDRESS_NONE`.

`read_imagef` returns floating-point values in the range [0.0... 1.0] for image objects created with `image_channel_data_type` set to one of the predefined packed formats or `CL_UNORM_INT8` or `CL_UNORM_INT16`.

`read_imagef` returns floating-point values in the range [-1.0... 1.0] for image objects created with `image_channel_data_type` set to `CL_SNORM_INT8`, or `CL_SNORM_INT16`.

`read_imagef` returns floating-point values for image objects created with `image_channel_data_type` set to `CL_HALF_FLOAT` or `CL_FLOAT`.

The `read_imagef` calls that take integer coordinates must use a sampler with filter mode set to `CLK_FILTER_NEAREST`, normalized coordinates set to `CLK_NORMALIZED_COORDS_FALSE` and addressing mode set to `CLK_ADDRESS_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, `CLK_ADDRESS_CLAMP` or `CLK_ADDRESS_NONE`; otherwise the values returned are undefined.

Values returned by `read_imagef` for image objects with `image_channel_data_type` values not specified in the description above are undefined.

[[notes]]
== Notes

General information about the `read_image`* functions follows.

include::imageFunctionsInc.adoc[]

include::imageMappingInc.adoc[]

.Mipmap read image functions:

`CL_SAMPLER_NORMALIZED_COORDS` must be `CL_TRUE` for built-in functions described in the table above that read from a mip-mapped image; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
The value specified in the `lod` argument is clamped to the minimum of (actual number of mip-levels â€“ 1) in the image or value specified for `CL_SAMPLER_LOD_MAX`.
