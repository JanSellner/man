[[description]]
== Description

These operations perform arithmetic and bitwise computations.
All of these operations are applicable to an object of any atomic integer type.
The key, operator, and computation correspondence is given in the table below:

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|key
|op
|computation

|`add`
|+
|addition

|`sub`
|-
|subtraction

|`or`
|\|
|bitwise inclusive or

|`xor`
|^
|bitwise exclusive or

|`and`
|&
|bitwise and

|`min`
|min
|compute min

|`max`
|max
|compute max

|===

For atomic_fetch and modify functions with key = add or sub on atomic types `atomic_intptr_t` and `atomic_uintptr_t`, `M` is `ptrdiff_t`.
For atomic_fetch and modify functions with key = or, xor, and, min and max on atomic types `atomic_intptr_t` and `atomic_uintptr_t`, `M` is `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t`.

Atomically replaces the value pointed to by `object` with the result of the computation applied to the value pointed to by `object` and the given operand.
Memory is affected according to the value of `order`.
These operations are atomic read-modify-write operations (as defined by section 5.1.2.4 of the C11 specification).
For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use twoâ€™s complement representation with silent wrap-around on overflow; there are no undefined results.
For address types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operations otherwise have no undefined behavior.
Returns atomically, the value pointed to by `object` immediately before the effects.
