[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`image`::

Specifies the image object being queried.

`param_name`::

Specifies the information to query.
The list of supported `param_name` types and the information returned in `param_value` by `clGetImageInfo` is described in the table below (Table 5.9).

`param_value`::

A pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned.
If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`::

+
--

Used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size must be â‰¥ size of return type as described in the table below (Table 5.9).

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|cl_image_info
|Return Type
|Info.
returned in `param_value`

|`CL_IMAGE_FORMAT`
|cl_image_format
|Return image format descriptor specified when `image` is created with <<clCreateImage.adoc#, `clCreateImage`>>.

|`CL_IMAGE_ELEMENT_SIZE`
|size_t
|Return size of each element of the image memory object given by `image` in bytes.
An element is made up of `n` channels.
The value of `n` is given in <<cl_image_format.adoc#, `cl_image_format`>> descriptor.

|`CL_IMAGE_ROW_PITCH`
|size_t
|Return calculated row pitch in bytes of a row of elements of the image object given by `image`.

|`CL_IMAGE_SLICE_PITCH`
|size_t
|Return calculated slice pitch in bytes of a 2D slice for the 3D image object or size of each image in a 1D or 2D image array given by `image`.
For a 1D image, 1D image buffer and 2D image object return 0.

|`CL_IMAGE_WIDTH`
|size_t
|Return width of image in pixels.

|`CL_IMAGE_HEIGHT`
|size_t
|Return height of image in pixels.
For a 1D image, 1D image buffer and 1D image array object, height = 0.

|`CL_IMAGE_DEPTH`
|size_t
|Return depth of the image in pixels.
For a 1D image, 1D image buffer, 2D image or 1D and 2D image array object, depth = 0.

|`CL_IMAGE_ARRAY_SIZE`
|size_t
|Return number of images in the image array.
If `image` is not an image array, 0 is returned.

|`CL_IMAGE_NUM_MIP_LEVELS`
|cl_uint
|Return num_mip_levels associated with `image`.

|`CL_IMAGE_NUM_SAMPLES`
|cl_uint
|Return num_samples associated with `image`.

|`CL_IMAGE_D3D10_SUBRESOURCE_KHR`
|ID3D10Resource *
|(if the <<cl_khr_d3d10_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d10_sharing`>> extension is enabled) If `image` was created using <<clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR`>> or <<clCreateFromD3D10Texture3DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D10Texture3DKHR`>>, returns the `subresource` argument specified when `image` was created.

|`CL_IMAGE_DX9_MEDIA_PLANE_KHR`
|cl_uint
|Returns the `plane` argument value specified when `memobj` is created using <<clCreateFromDX9MediaSurfaceKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromDX9MediaSurfaceKHR`>>. (If the <<cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing`>> extension is supported)

|`CL_IMAGE_D3D11_- SUBRESOURCE_KHR`
|ID3D11Resource *
|If the <<cl_khr_d3d11_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d11_sharing`>> extension is suported, If `image` was created using <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR`>>, or <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR`>>, returns the `subresource` argument specified when `image` was created.

|`CL_IMAGE_D3D11_- SUBRESOURCE_KHR`
|UINT
|If the <<cl_khr_d3d11_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d11_sharing`>> extension is suported, If `image` was created using <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR`>>, or <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR`>>, returns the `subresource` argument specified when `image` was created.

|`CL_IMAGE_D3D11_- SUBRESOURCE_KHR`
|UINT
|If the <<cl_khr_d3d11_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d11_sharing`>> extension is suported, If `image` was created using <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR`>>, or <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR`>>, returns the `subresource` argument specified when `image` was created.

`param_value_size_ret`::

Returns the actual size in bytes of data being queried by `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.


[[notes]]
== Notes

To get information that is common to all memory objects, use the <<clGetMemObjectInfo.adoc#, `clGetMemObjectInfo`>> function.


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is < size of return type as described in the table above and `param_value` is not NULL.

* `CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT` if `image` is a not a valid image object.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

* `CL_INVALID_DX9_MEDIA_SURFACE_KHR` if `param_name` is `CL_IMAGE_DX9_MEDIA_PLANE_KHR` and `image` was not created by the function <<clCreateFromDX9MediaSurfaceKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromDX9MediaSurfaceKHR`>>. (If the <<cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing`>> extension is supported)

* `CL_INVALID_D3D10_RESOURCE_KHR` if `param_name` is `CL_MEM_D3D10_SUBRESOURCE_KHR` and `image` was not created by the function <<clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR`>> or <<clCreateFromD3D10Texture3DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D10Texture3DKHR`>>. (If the <<cl_khr_d3d10_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d10_sharing`>> extension is supported)

* `CL_INVALID_D3D11_RESOURCE_KHR` if `param_name` is `CL_MEM_D3D11_SUBRESOURCE_KHR` and `image` was not created by the function <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture2DKHR`>> or <<clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR.adoc#, `clCreateFromD3D11Texture3DKHR`>>. (If the <<cl_khr_d3d11_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d11_sharing`>> extension is supported)
