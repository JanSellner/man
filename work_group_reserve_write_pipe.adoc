== Description

Reserve `num_packets` entries for writing to pipe `p`.
Returns a valid reservation ID if the reservation is successful.

The reserved pipe entries are referred to by indices that go from 0 ... `num_packets` â€“ 1.

This built-in function must be encountered by all work-items in a work-group executing the kernel with the same argument values; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
