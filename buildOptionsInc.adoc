.Compiler Options

The compiler options are categorized as pre-processor options, options for math intrinsics, options that control optimization and miscellaneous options.
This specification defines a standard set of options that must be supported by the OpenCL C compiler when building program executables online or offline.
These may be extended by a set of vendor- or platform specific options.

.Preprocessor Options

These options control the OpenCL C preprocessor which is run on each program source before actual compilation.

-D options are processed in the order they are given in the `options` argument to `clBuildProgram` or `clCompileProgram`.

-D name::

Predefine `name` as a macro, with definition 1.

-D name=definition::

The contents of `definition` are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a '#define' directive.
In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline characters.

-I dir::

Add the directory `dir` to the list of directories to be searched for header files.

.Math Intrinsics Options

These options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point arithmetic.
These options trade off between speed and correctness.

-cl-single-precision-constant::

Treat double precision floating-point constant as single precision constant.

-cl-denorms-are-zero::

+
--

This option controls how single precision and double precision denormalized numbers are handled.
If specified as a build option, the single precision denormalized numbers may be flushed to zero; double precision denormalized numbers may also be flushed to zero if the optional extension for double precsion is supported.
This is intended to be a performance hint and the OpenCL compiler can choose not to flush denorms to zero if the device supports single precision (or double precision) denormalized numbers.

This option is ignored for single precision numbers if the device does not support single precision denormalized numbers i.e.
`CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_SINGLE_FP_CONFIG`.

This option is ignored for double precision numbers if the device does not support double precision or if it does support double precison but not double precision denormalized numbers i.e.
`CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_DOUBLE_FP_CONFIG`.

This flag only applies for scalar and vector single precision floating-point variables and computations on these floating-point variables inside a program.
It does not apply to reading from or writing to image objects.

-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt::

+
--

The `-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt` build option to `clBuildProgram` or `clCompileProgram` allows an application to specify that single precision floating-point divide (x/y and 1/x) and sqrt used in the program source are correctly rounded.
If this build option is not specified, the minimum numerical accuracy of single precision floating-point divide and sqrt are as defined in section 7.4 of the OpenCL specification.

This build option can only be specified if the `CL_FP_CORRECTLY_ROUNDED_DIVIDE_SQRT` is set in `CL_DEVICE_SINGLE_FP_CONFIG` (as defined in in the table of allowed values for `param_name` for <<clGetDeviceInfo.adoc#, `clGetDeviceInfo`>>) for devices that the program is being build.
`clBuildProgram` or `clCompileProgram` will fail to compile the program for a device if the `-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt` option is specified and `CL_FP_CORRECTLY_ROUNDED_DIVIDE_SQRT` is not set for the device.

--

.Optimization Options

These options control various sorts of optimizations.
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.

-cl-opt-disable::

This option disables all optimizations.
The default is optimizations are enabled.

The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point arithmetic.
These options trade off between performance and correctness and must be specifically enabled.
These options are not turned on by default since it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE 754 rules/specifications for math functions.

-cl-mad-enable::

Allow `a * b + c` to be replaced by a `mad`.
The `mad` computes `a * b + c` with reduced accuracy.
For example, some OpenCL devices implement `mad` as truncate the result of `a * b` before adding it to `c`.

-cl-no-signed-zeros::

Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the signedness of zero.
IEEE 754 arithmetic specifies the distinct behavior of `+0.0` and `-0.0` values, which then prohibits simplification of expressions such as `x+0.0` or `0.0*x` (even with `-clfinite-math` only).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.

-cl-unsafe-math-optimizations::

Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume that arguments and results are valid, (b) may violate IEEE 754 standard and (c) may violate the OpenCL numerical compliance requirements as defined in section 7.4 for single precision and double precision floating-point, and edge case behavior in section 7.5.
This option includes the `-cl-no-signed-zeros` and `-cl-mad-enable` options.

-cl-finite-math-only::

Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that arguments and results are not NaNs or ±∞.
This option may violate the OpenCL numerical compliance requirements defined in section 7.4 for single precision and double precision floating point, and edge case behavior in section 7.5.

-cl-fast-relaxed-math::

Sets the optimization options `-cl-finite-math-only` and `-cl-unsafe-math-optimizations`.
This allows optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that may violate the IEEE 754 standard and the OpenCL numerical compliance requirements defined in the specification in section 7.4 for single-precision and double precision floating-point, and edge case behavior in section 7.5.
This option also relaxes the precision of commonly used math functions (refer to table 7.2 defined in section 7.4).
This option causes the preprocessor macro `__FAST_RELAXED_MATH__` to be defined in the OpenCL program.

-cl-uniform-work-group-size::

This requires that the global work-size be a multiple of the work-group size specified to <<clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.adoc#, `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`>>.
Allow optimizations that are made possible by this restriction.

.Options to Request or Suppress Warnings

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there may have been an error.
The following language independent options do not enable specific warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by the OpenCL compiler.

-w::

Inhibit all warning messages.

-Werror::

Make all warnings into errors.

.Options Controlling the OpenCL C Version

The following option controls the version of OpenCL C that the compiler accepts.

-cl-std=::

+
--

Determine the OpenCL C language version to use.
A value for this option must be provided.
Valid values are:

`CL1.1` - Support all OpenCL C programs that use the OpenCL C language features defined in section 6 of the OpenCL 1.1 specification.

`CL1.2` - Support all OpenCL C programs that use the OpenCL C language features defined in section 6 of the OpenCL 1.2 specification.

`CL2.0` - Support all OpenCL C programs that use the OpenCL C language features defined in section 6 of the OpenCL 2.0 specification.

--

Calls to `clBuildProgram` or `clCompileProgram` with the `-cl-std=CL1.1` option will fail to compile the program for any devices with `CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION` = OpenCL C 1.0.

Calls to `clBuildProgram` or `clCompileProgram` with the `-cl-std=CL1.2` option will fail to compile the program for any devices with `CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION` = OpenCL C 1.0 or OpenCL C 1.1.

Calls to `clBuildProgram` or `clCompileProgram` with the `-cl-std=CL2.0` option will fail to compile the program for any devices with `CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION` = OpenCL C 1.0, OpenCL C 1.1, or OpenCL C 1.2.

If the `–cl-std` build option is not specified, the highest OpenCL C 1.x language version supported by each device is used when compiling the program for each device.
Applications are required to specify the `–cl-std=CL2.0` option if they want to compile or build their programs with OpenCL C 2.0.

.Options enabled by the cl_khr_spir extension

-x spir::

Indicates that the binary is in SPIR format.

-spir-std::

Specifies the version of the SPIR specification that describes the format and meaning of the binary.
For example, if the binary is as described in SPIR version 1.2, then `-spir-std=1.2` must be specified.
Failing to specify these compile options may result in implementation defined behavior.

.Options for Querying Kernel Argument Information

-cl-kernel-arg-info::

This option allows the compiler to store information about the arguments of a kernel(s) in the program executable.
The argument information stored includes the argument name, its type, the address and access qualifiers used.
Refer to description of <<clGetKernelArgInfo.adoc#, `clGetKernelArgInfo`>> on how to query this information.

.Options for debugging your program

-g::

This option can currently be used to generate additional errors for the built-in functions that allow you to enqueue commands on a device (refer to section 6.13.17).

.Linker Options

This specification defines a standard set of linker options that must be supported by the OpenCL C compiler when linking compiled programs online or offline.
These linker options are categorized as library linking options and program linking options.
These may be extended by a set of vendor- or platform-specific options.

.Library Linking Options

The following options can be specified when creating a library of compiled binaries.

-create-library::

Create a library of compiled binaries specified in `input_programs` argument to <<clLinkProgram.adoc#, `clLinkProgram`>>.

-enable-link-options::

Allows the linker to modify the library behavior based on one or more link options (described in Program Linking Options, below) when this library is linked with a program executable.
This option must be specified with the `-create-library` option.

.Program Linking Options

The following options can be specified when linking a program executable.

* `-cl-denorms-are-zero`

* `-cl-no-signed-zeroes`

* `-cl-unsafe-math-optimizations`

* `-cl-finite-math-only`

* `-cl-fast-relaxed-mat`

The linker may apply these options to all compiled program objects specified to <<clLinkProgram.adoc#, `clLinkProgram`>>.
The linker may apply these options only to libraries which were created with the `-enable-link-option`.

.Separate Compilation and Linking of Programs

OpenCL programs are compiled and linked to support the following:

* Separate compilation and link stages.
Program sources can be compiled to generate a compiled binary object and linked in a separate stage with other compiled program objects to the program exectuable.

* Embedded headers.
In OpenCL 1.0 and 1.1, the `-I` build option could be used to specify the list of directories to be searched for headers files that are included by a program source(s).
OpenCL 1.2 extends this by allowing the header sources to come from program objects instead of just header files.

* Libraries.
The linker can be used to link compiled objects and libraries into a program executable or to create a library of compiled binaries.
