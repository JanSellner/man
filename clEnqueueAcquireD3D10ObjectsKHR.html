If <code>event_wait_list</code> is NULL, then this particular command does not wait on any event to complete.
If <code>event_wait_list</code> is NULL, <code>num_events_in_wait_list</code> must be 0.

<p>The Direct3D 10 objects are acquired by the OpenCL context associated with <code>command-queue</code> and can therefore be used by all command-queues associated with the OpenCL context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenCL memory objects created from Direct3D 10 resources must be acquired before they can be used by any OpenCL commands queued to a command-queue.
If an OpenCL memory object created from a Direct3D 10 resource is used while it is not currently acquired by OpenCL, the call attempting to use that OpenCL memory object will return <code>CL_D3D10_RESOURCE_NOT_ACQUIRED_KHR</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <code>CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC</code> is not specified as <code>CL_TRUE</code> during context creation, <code>clEnqueueAcquireD3D10ObjectsKHR</code> provides the synchronization guarantee that any Direct3D 10 calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made before <code>clEnqueueAcquireD3D10ObjectsKHR</code> is called will complete executing before <code>event</code> reports completion and before the execution of any subsequent OpenCL work issued in <code>command_queue</code> begins.
If the context was created with properties specifying <code>CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC</code> as <code>CL_TRUE</code>, the user is responsible for guaranteeing that any Direct3D 10 calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made before <code>clEnqueueAcquireD3D10ObjectsKHR</code> is called have completed before calling <code>clEnqueueAcquireD3D10ObjectsKHR</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>General information about sharing memory objects with Direct3D 10 follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this extension is to provide interoperability between OpenCL and Direct3D 10.
This is designed to function analogously to the <a href="cl_khr_gl_sharing.html">OpenGL interoperability</a> as defined in sections 9.7 and 9.8.
If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string "cl_khr_d3d10_sharing" will be present in the <code>CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS</code> (see <a href="clGetPlatformInfo.html"><code>clGetPlatformInfo</code></a>) or <code>CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS</code> (see <a href="clGetDeviceInfo.html"><code>clGetDeviceInfo</code></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As currently proposed the interfaces for this extension would be provided in <code>cl_d3d10.h</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenCL functions enabled by the <code>cl_khr_d3d10_sharing</code> extension allow applications to use Direct3D 10 resources as OpenCL memory objects.
This allows efficient sharing of data between OpenCL and Direct3D 10.
The OpenCL API may be used to execute kernels that read and/or write memory objects that are also Direct3D 10 resources.
An OpenCL image object may be created from a Direct3D 10 texture resource.
An OpenCL buffer object may be created from a Direct3D 10 buffer resource.
OpenCL memory objects may be created from Direct3D 10 objects if and only if the OpenCL context has been created from a Direct3D 10 device.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Lifetime of Shared [D3D10] Objects</div>
<p>An OpenCL memory object created from a Direct3D 10 resource remains valid as long as the corresponding Direct3D 10 resource has not been deleted.
If the Direct3D 10 resource is deleted through the Direct3D 10 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL memory object will result in undefined behavior, including but not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The successful creation of a cl_context against a Direct3D 10 device specified via the context create parameter <code>CL_CONTEXT_D3D10_DEVICE_KHR</code> will increment the internal Direct3D reference count on the specified Direct3D 10 device.
The internal Direct3D reference count on that Direct3D 10 device will be decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL context drops to zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenCL context and corresponding command-queues are dependent on the existence of the Direct3D 10 device from which the OpenCL context was created.
If the Direct3D 10 device is deleted through the Direct3D 10 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL context will result in undefined behavior, including but not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.</p>

<p>Returns <code>CL_SUCCESS</code> if the function is executed successfully.
If <code>num_objects</code> is 0 and <code>mem_objects</code> is NULL then the function does nothing and returns <code>CL_SUCCESS</code>.
