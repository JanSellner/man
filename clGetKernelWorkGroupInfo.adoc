[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`kernel`::

Specifies the kernel object being queried.

`device`::

Identifies a specific device in the list of devices associated with `kernel`.
The list of devices is the list of devices in the OpenCL context that is associated with `kernel`.
If the list of devices associated with `kernel` is a single device, `device` can be a NULL value.

`param_name`::

Specifies the information to query.
The list of supported `param_name` types and the information returned in `param_value` by `clGetKernelWorkGroupInfo` is described in the table below.

`param_value`::

A pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned.
If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`::

+
--

Used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size must be â‰¥ size of return type as described in the table below.

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|cl_kernel_work_group_info
|Return Type
|Info.
returned in `param_value`

|`CL_KERNEL_GLOBAL_WORK_SIZE`
|size_t[3]
|This provides a mechanism for the application to query the maximum global size that can be used to execute a kernel (i.e.
`global_work_size` argument to <<clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.adoc#, `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`>>) on a custom device given by `device` or a built-in kernel on an OpenCL device given by `device`.

If `device` is not a custom device or `kernel` is not a built-in kernel, `clGetKernelWorkGroupInfo` returns the error `CL_INVALID_VALUE`.

|`CL_KERNEL_WORK_GROUP_SIZE`
|size_t
|

This provides a mechanism for the application to query the maximum work-group size that can be used to execute the kernel on a specific device given by `device`.
The OpenCL implementation uses the resource requirements of the kernel (register usage etc.) to determine what this work-group size should be.

As a result and unlike `CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE` this value may vary from one kernel to another as well as one device to another.

`CL_KERNEL_WORK_GROUP_SIZE` will be less than or equal to `CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE` for a given kernel object.

|`CL_KERNEL_COMPILE_- WORK_GROUP_SIZE`
|size_t[3]
|Returns the work-group size specified in the kernel source or IL.
If the work-group size is not specified in the kernel source or IL, (0, 0, 0) is returned.

|`CL_KERNEL_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE`
|cl_ulong
|

Returns the amount of local memory in bytes being used by a kernel.
This includes local memory that may be needed by an implementation to execute the kernel, variables declared inside the kernel with the <<local.adoc#, `__local`>> address qualifier and local memory to be allocated for arguments to the kernel declared as pointers with the <<local.adoc#, `__local`>> address qualifier and whose size is specified with <<clSetKernelArg.adoc#, `clSetKernelArg`>>.

If the local memory size, for any pointer argument to the kernel declared with the <<local.adoc#, `__local`>> address qualifier, is not specified, its size is assumed to be 0.

|`CL_KERNEL_PREFERRED_WORK_- GROUP_SIZE_MULTIPLE`
|size_t
|Returns the preferred multiple of workgroup size for launch.
This is a performance hint.
Specifying a workgroup size that is not a multiple of the value returned by this query as the value of the local work size argument to <<clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.adoc#, `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`>> will not fail to enqueue the kernel for execution unless the work-group size specified is larger than the device maximum.

|`CL_KERNEL_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE`
|cl_ulong
|Returns the minimum amount of private memory, in bytes, used by each work-item in the kernel.
This value may include any private memory needed by an implementation to execute the kernel, including that used by the language built-ins and variable declared inside the kernel with the <<private.adoc#, `__private`>> qualifier.

`param_value_size_ret`::

Returns the actual size in bytes of data copied to `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_DEVICE` if `device` is not in the list of devices associated with `kernel` or if `device` is NULL but there is more than one device associated with `kernel`.

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is < size of return type as described in the table above and `param_value` is not NULL.

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is `CL_KERNEL_GLOBAL_WORK_SIZE` and `device` is not a custom device and `kernel` is not a built-in kernel.

* `CL_INVALID_KERNEL` if `kernel` is a not a valid kernel object.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
