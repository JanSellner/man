<p>OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is an open royalty-free standard for general purpose parallel programming across CPUs, GPUs and other processors, giving software developers portable and efficient access to the power of these heterogeneous processing platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenCL supports a wide range of applications, ranging from embedded and consumer software to HPC solutions, through a low-level, high-performance, portable abstraction.
By creating an efficient, close-to-the-metal programming interface, OpenCL will form the foundation layer of a parallel computing ecosystem of platform-independent tools, middleware and applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenCL consists of an API for coordinating parallel computation across heterogeneous processors; and a cross-platform programming language with a well-specified computation environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenCL standard:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Supports both data- and task-based parallel programming models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilizes a subset of ISO C99 with extensions for parallelism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defines consistent numerical requirements based on IEEE 754</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defines a configuration profile for handheld and embedded devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiently interoperates with OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and other graphics APIs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The specification is divided into a core specification that any OpenCL compliant implementation must support; a handheld/embedded profile which relaxes the OpenCL compliance requirements for handheld and embedded devices; and a set of optional extensions that are likely to move into the core specification in later revisions of the OpenCL specification.</p>
