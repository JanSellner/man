== Description

For the form without `reserve_id`, read packet from pipe `p` into `ptr`.
Returns 0 if `read_pipe` is successful and a negative value if the pipe is empty.

For the form using `reserve_id`, read packet from the reserved area of the pipe referred to by `reserve_id` and `index` into `ptr`.
The reserved pipe entries are referred to by indices that go from 0 ... `num_packets` â€“ 1.
Returns 0 if `read_pipe` is successful and a negative value otherwise.
