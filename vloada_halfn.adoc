Read half float vector from a pointer to memory.

[[description]]
== Description

For n = 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 read sizeof(`halfn`) bytes of data from address (`p` + (`offset` * `n`)).
The data read is interpreted as a `halfn` value.
The `halfn` value read is converted to a `floatn` value and the `floatn` value is returned.

The address computed as (`p` + (`offset` * `n`)) must be aligned to sizeof(`halfn`) bytes.

For n = 3, `vloada_half3` reads a `half3` from address (`p` + (`offset` * 4)) and returns a `float3`.
The address computed as (`p` + (`offset` * 4)) must be aligned to sizeof (`half`) * 4 bytes.

In addition `vloada_half3` reads `x`, `y`, `z` components from address (`p` + (`offset` * 4)) into a 3- component vector.
