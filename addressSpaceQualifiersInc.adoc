.General information about address space qualifiers

OpenCL implements the following disjoint named address spaces: `__global`, `__local`, `__constant`, and `__private`.
The address space qualifier may be used in variable declarations to specify the region of memory that is used to allocate the object.
The C syntax for type qualifiers is extended in OpenCL to include an address space name as a valid type qualifier.
If the type of an object is qualified by an address space name, the object is allocated in the specified address name; otherwise, the object is allocated in the generic address space.

The address space names without the __ prefix i.e.
`global`, `local`, `constant` and `private` may be substituted for the corresponding address space names with the __ prefix.

The address space name for arguments to a function in a program, or local variables of a function is `__private`.
All function arguments shall be in the `__private` address space.
The address space for a variable at program scope or a static variable inside a function can either be `__global` or `__constant`, but defaults to `__global` if not specified.

OpenCL 2.0 adds support for an unnamed `generic` address space.
Pointers that are declared without pointing to a named address space point to the `generic` address space.
Before referring to the region pointed to, the pointer must be associated with a named address space.
Functions may be written with arguments and return values that point to the `generic` address space.

kernel function arguments declared to be a pointer or an array of a type must point to one of the named address spaces `__global`, `__local` or `__constant`.

The named address spaces are a subset of the generic address space except for the `constant` address space.

A pointer to address space A can only be assigned to a pointer to the same address space A or a pointer to the `generic` address space.
Casting a pointer to address space A to a pointer to address space B is illegal if A and B are named address spaces and A is not the same as B.

The `__global`, `__constant`, `__local`, `__private`, `__generic`, `global`, `constant`, `local`, and `private` names are reserved for use as address space qualifiers and shall not be used otherwise.
The `__generic` and `generic` names are reserved for future use.

The size of pointers to different address spaces may differ.
It is not correct to assume that, for example, `sizeof(__global int *)` always equals `sizeof(__local int *)`.
