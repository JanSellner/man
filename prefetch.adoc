[[description]]
== Description

`prefetch` prefetches `num_gentypes` * sizeof(`gentype`) bytes into the global cache.
The prefetch instruction is applied to a work-item in a work-group and does not affect the functional behavior of the kernel.

The kernel must wait for the completion of all async copies using the `wait_group_events` built-in function before exiting; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
