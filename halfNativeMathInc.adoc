.Half and Native forms

A subset of Math functions (table 6.8) are defined with the `half_` prefix.
These functions are implemented with a minimum of 10-bits of accuracy i.e.
an ULP value â‰¤ 8192 ulp.

A subset of Math functions (table 6.8) are defined with the `native_` prefix.
These functions may map to one or more native device instructions and will typically have better performance compared to the corresponding functions (without the `native__` prefix).
The accuracy (and in some cases the input range(s)) of these functions is implementation-defined.

For the half and native forms, we use the generic type name gentype to indicate that the functions (table 6.9) can take `float`, `float2`, `float3`, `float4`, `float8` or `float16` as the type for the arguments.

Support for denormal values is optional for `half_` functions.
The `half_` functions may return any result allowed by section 7.5.3, even when `-cl-denorms-are-zero` (see section 5.8.4.2) is not in force.
Support for denormal values is implementation-defined for `native_` functions.
