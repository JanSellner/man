[[description]]
== Description

Enqueue a marker command to `queue`.
The marker command waits for a list of events to complete, or if the list is empty it waits for all previously enqueued commands in `queue` to complete before the marker completes.

`event_ret` must not be NULL as otherwise this is a no-op.

If an event is returned, `enqueue_marker` performs an implicit retain on the returned event.


[[errors]]
== Errors

`enqueue_marker` returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the marked command is enqueued successfully and returns `CL_ENQUEUE_FAILURE` otherwise.
If the `â€“g` compile option is specified in compiler options passed to <<clCompileProgram.adoc#, `clCompileProgram`>> or <<clBuildProgram.adoc#, `clBuildProgram`>>, the following errors may be returned instead of `CL_ENQUEUE_FAILURE` to indicate why <<enqueue_marker.adoc#, `enqueue_marker`>> failed to enqueue the marker command:

* `CLK_INVALID_QUEUE` if `queue` is not a valid device queue.

* `CLK_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST` if `event_wait_list` is NULL and `num_events_in_wait_list` is greater than zero, or if `event_wait_list` is not NULL and `num_events_in_wait_list` is zero, or if event objects in `event_wait_list` are not valid events.

* `CLK_DEVICE_QUEUE_FULL` if `queue` is full.

* `CLK_EVENT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE` if `event_ret` is not NULL and an event could not be allocated.

* `CLK_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to queue the block in `queue` because of insufficient resources needed to execute the kernel.
