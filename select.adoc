For each component of a vector type, result[`i`] = if MSB of `c`[`i`] is set ? `b`[`i`] : `a`[`i`].
For scalar type, _result_ = `c` ? `b` : `a`.

[[description]]
== Description

For each component of a vector type, result[`i`] = if MSB of `c`[`i`] is set ? `b`[`i`] : `a`[`i`].

For scalar type, _result_ = `c` ? `b` : `a`.

`igentype` and `ugentype` must have the same number of elements and bits as `gentype`.

NOTE: The above definition means that the behavior of select and the ternary operator for vector and scalar types is dependent on different interpretations of the bit pattern of `c`.
