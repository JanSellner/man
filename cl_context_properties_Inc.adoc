List of supported `properties` (Table 4.5)

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|cl_context_properties enum
|Property value
|Description

|`CL_CONTEXT_PLATFORM`
|cl_platform_id
|Specifies the platform to use.

|`CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC`
|cl_bool
|Specifies whether the user is responsible for synchronization between OpenCL and other APIs.
Please refer to the specific sections in the OpenCL 2.0 extension specification that describe sharing with other APIs for restrictions on using this flag.
If `CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC` is not specified, a default of `CL_FALSE` is assumed.
OpenCL / OpenGL sharing does not support the `CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC` property defined in table 4.5.
Specifying this property when creating a context with OpenCL / OpenGL sharing will return an appropriate error.

|`CL_CONTEXT_D3D10_DEVICE_KHR`
|`ID3D10Device` *
|Specifies the `ID3D10Device` * to use for Direct3D 10 interoperability.
The default value is NULL (applies if the extension <<cl_khr_d3d10_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d10_sharing`>> is supported)

|`CL_CONTEXT_ADAPTER_D3D9_KHR`
|`IDirect3DDevice9` *
|Specifies an `IDirect3DDevice9` to use for D3D9 interop (applies if the <<cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing`>> extension is supported)

|`CL_CONTEXT_ADAPTER_D3D9EX_KHR`
|`IDirect3DDeviceEx` *
|Specifies an `IDirect3DDevice9Ex` to use for D3D9 interop (applies if the <<cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing`>> extension is supported)

|`CL_CONTEXT_ADAPTER_DXVA_KHR`
|`IDXVAHD_Device` *
|Specifies an `IDXVAHD_Device` to use for DXVA interop (applies if the <<cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing`>> extension is supported)

|`CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR`
|0, OpenGL context handle
|OpenGL context to associated the OpenCL context with (available if the <<cl_khr_gl_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_gl_sharing`>> extension is enabled)

|`CL_CGL_SHAREGROUP_KHR`
|0, CGL share group handle
|CGL share group to associate the OpenCL context with (available if the <<cl_khr_gl_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_gl_sharing`>> extension is enabled)

|`CL_EGL_DISPLAY_KHR`
|`EGL_NO_DISPLAY`, `EGLDisplay` handle
|EGLDisplay an OpenGL context was created with respect to (available if the <<cl_khr_gl_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_gl_sharing`>> extension is enabled)

|`CL_GLX_DISPLAY_KHR`
|None, X handle
|X Display an OpenGL context was created with respect to (available if the <<cl_khr_gl_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_gl_sharing`>> extension is enabled)

|`CL_WGL_HDC_KHR`
|0, HDC handle
|HDC an OpenGL context was created with respect to (available if the <<cl_khr_gl_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_gl_sharing`>> extension is enabled)

|`CL_CONTEXT_D3D11_DEVICE_KHR`
|`ID3D11Device` *
|Specifies the `ID3D11Device` * to use for Direct3D 11 interoperability.
The default value is NULL. (Applies if the <<cl_khr_d3d11_sharing.adoc#, `cl_khr_d3d11_sharing`>> extension is supported.)

|`CL_CONTEXT_MEMORY_INITIALIZE_KHR`
|`cl_context_memory- _initialize_khr`
|

Describes which memory types for the context must be initialized.
This is a bit-field, where the following values are currently supported:

`CL_CONTEXT_MEMORY_INITIALIZE_LOCAL_KHR` - Initialize local memory to zeros.

`CL_CONTEXT_MEMORY_INITIALIZE_PRIVATE_KHR` - Initialize private memory to zeros.

(applies if the <<cl_khr_initialize_memory.adoc#, `cl_khr_initialize_memory`>> extension is supported)

|`CL_CONTEXT_TERMINATE_KHR`
|`cl_bool`
|Specifies whether the context can be terminated.
The default value is `CL_FALSE`. (applies if the <<cl_khr_terminate_context.adoc#, `cl_khr_terminate_context`>> extension is supported)
