.Multiple Host Threads

An OpenCL API call is considered to be _thread-safe_ if the internal state as managed by OpenCL remains consistent when called simultaneously by multiple _host_ threads.
OpenCL API calls that are _thread-safe_ allow an application to call these functions in multiple _host_ threads without having to implement mutual exclusion across these _host_ threads i.e.
they are also re-entrant-safe.

All OpenCL API calls are thread-safe except those that modify the state of cl_kernel objects: <<clSetKernelArg.adoc#, `clSetKernelArg`>>, <<clSetKernelArgSVMPointer.adoc#, `clSetKernelArgSVMPointer`>>, <<clSetKernelExecInfo.adoc#, `clSetKernelExecInfo`>> and <<clCloneKernel.adoc#, `clCloneKernel`>>.

<<clSetKernelArg.adoc#, `clSetKernelArg`>> , <<clSetKernelArgSVMPointer.adoc#, `clSetKernelArgSVMPointer`>>, <<clSetKernelExecInfo.adoc#, `clSetKernelExecInfo`>> and <<clCloneKernel.adoc#, `clCloneKernel`>> are safe to call from any host thread, and safe to call re-entrantly so long as concurrent calls to any combination of these API calls operate on different cl_kernel objects.
The state of the cl_kernel object is undefined if <<clSetKernelArg.adoc#, `clSetKernelArg`>>, <<clSetKernelArgSVMPointer.adoc#, `clSetKernelArgSVMPointer`>>, <<clSetKernelExecInfo.adoc#, `clSetKernelExecInfo`>> or <<clCloneKernel.adoc#, `clCloneKernel`>> are called from multiple host threads on the same cl_kernel object at the same time.
Please note that there are additional limitations as to which OpenCL APIs may be called from OpenCL callback functions -- please see section 5.11.

The behavior of OpenCL APIs called from an interrupt or signal handler is implementation-defined.

There is an inherent race condition in the design of OpenCL that occurs between setting a kernel argument and using the kernel with <<clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.adoc#, `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`>>.
Another host thread might change the kernel arguments between when a host thread sets the kernel arguments and then enqueues the kernel, causing the wrong kernel arguments to be enqueued.
Rather than attempt to share `cl_kernel` objects among multiple host threads, applications are strongly encouraged to make additional `cl_kernel` objects for kernel functions for each host thread.
