[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`kernel`::

Specifies the kernel object being queried.

`param_name`::

Specifies the information to query.
The list of supported `param_name` types and the information returned in `param_value` by `clGetKernelInfo` is described in the table below.

`param_value`::

A pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned.
If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`::

+
--

Used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size must be â‰¥ size of return type as described in the table below.


[[cl_kernel_info]]

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|cl_kernel_info
|Return Type
|Info.
returned in `param_value`

|`CL_KERNEL_FUNCTION_NAME`
|char[]
|Return the kernel function name.

|`CL_KERNEL_NUM_ARGS`
|cl_uint
|Return the number of arguments to `kernel`.

|`CL_KERNEL_REFERENCE_COUNT`
|cl_uint
|

Return the `kernel` reference count.

The reference count returned should be considered immediately stale.
It is unsuitable for general use in applications.
This feature is provided for identifying memory leaks.

|`CL_KERNEL_CONTEXT`
|cl_context
|Return the context associated with `kernel`.

|`CL_KERNEL_PROGRAM`
|cl_program
|Return the program object associated with `kernel`.

|`CL_KERNEL_ATTRIBUTES`
|char[]
|

Returns any attributes specified using the __<<attribute.adoc#, `attribute`>>__ qualifier with the kernel function declaration in the program source.
These attributes include those on the __<<attribute.adoc#, `attribute`>>__ page and other attributes supported by an implementation.

Attributes are returned as they were declared inside __<<attribute.adoc#, `attribute`>>__((...)), with any surrounding whitespace and embedded newlines removed.
When multiple attributes are present, they are returned as a single, space delimited string.

For kernels not created from OpenCL C source and the <<clCreateProgramWithSource.adoc#, `clCreateProgramWithSource`>> API call the string returned from this query will be empty.

|===

--

`param_value_size_ret`::

the actual size in bytes of data copied to `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is < size of return type as described in the table above and `param_value` is not NULL.

* `CL_INVALID_KERNEL` if `kernel` is not a valid kernel object.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
