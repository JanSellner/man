.Mipmap read image functions:

For the forms that take an `image3d_t` object, use the coordinate _coord.xyz_ to do an element lookup in the mip-level specified by `lod` in the 3D image object specified by `image`.

For the forms that use gradients, use the gradients to compute the lod and coordinate _coord.xyz_ to do an element lookup in the mip-level specified by the computed lod in the 3D image object specified by `image`.

When a multisample image is accessed in a kernel, the access takes one vector of integers describing which pixel to fetch and an integer corresponding to the sample numbers describing which sample within the pixel to fetch.
sample identifies the sample position in the multi-sample image.
