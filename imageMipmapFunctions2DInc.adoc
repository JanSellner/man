.Mipmap read image functions:

For the forms that take an `image2d_t` object, use the coordinate `coord.xy` to do an element lookup in the mip-level specified by `lod` in the 2D image object specified by `image`.

For the forms that use gradients, use the gradients to compute the lod and coordinate _coord.xy_ to do an element lookup in the mip-level specified by the computed lod in the 2D image object specified by `image`.

For the forms that take an `image2d_array_t` object, use the coordinate _coord.xy_ to do an element lookup in the 2D image identified by _coord.z_ and mip-level specified by `lod` in the 2D image object specified by `image`.

For the forms that take an `image2d_array_t` object and that use gradients, use the gradients to compute the lod coordinate and _coord.xy_ to do an element lookup in the 2D image identified by _coord.z_ and mip-level specified by `lod` in the 2D image object specified by `image`.

When a multisample image is accessed in a kernel, the access takes one vector of integers describing which pixel to fetch and an integer corresponding to the sample numbers describing which sample within the pixel to fetch.
sample identifies the sample position in the multi-sample image.

NOTE: `CL_SAMPLER_NORMALIZED_COORDS` must be `CL_TRUE` for built-in functions described in the table above that read from a mip-mapped image; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
The value specified in the `lod` argument is clamped to the minimum of (actual number of mip-levels - 1) in the image or value specified for `CL_SAMPLER_LOD_MAX`.
