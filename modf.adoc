gentype modf(gentype x,
             gentype *iptr)

[[description]]
== Description

Decompose a floating-point number.
The `modf` function breaks the argument `x` into integral and fractional parts, each of which has the same sign as the argument.
It stores the integral part in the object pointed to by `iptr`.


[[notes]]
== Notes

`modf` behaves as though implemented by:

----
          gentype modf ( gentype value, gentype *iptr )
          {
                    *iptr = trunc( value );
                    return copysign( isinf( value ) ? 0.0 : value -  *iptr, value );
          }
