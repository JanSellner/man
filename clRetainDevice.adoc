[[clRetainDevice]]
= clRetainDevice

Increments the `device` reference count.

[source,c]
----
cl_int clRetainDevice(cl_device_id device)
----


[[notes]]
== Notes

Increments the `device` reference count if `device` is a valid sub-device created by a call to <<clCreateSubDevices.adoc#, `clCreateSubDevices`>>.
If `device` is a root level device i.e.
a `cl_device_id` returned by <<clGetDeviceIDs.adoc#, `clGetDeviceIDs`>>, the `device` reference count remains unchanged.


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully or the device is a root-level device.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_DEVICE` if `device` is not a valid sub-device created by a call to <<clCreateSubDevices.adoc#, `clCreateSubDevices`>>.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
