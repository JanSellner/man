[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`kernel`::

Specifies the kernel object being queried.

`device`::

Identifies a specific device in the list of devices associated with `kernel`.
The list of devices is the list of devices in the OpenCL context that is associated with `kernel`.
If the list of devices associated with `kernel` is a single device, `device` can be a NULL value.

`param_name`::

Specifies the information to query.
The list of supported `param_name` types and the information returned in `param_value` by `clGetKernelSubGroupInfo` is described in the table below.

`input_value_size`::

Specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `input_value`.
This size must be == size of input type as described in table below.

`input_value`::

A pointer to memory where the appropriate parameterization of the query is passed from.
If `input_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value`::

A pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned.
If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`::

Used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size must be â‰¥ size of return type as described in the table below.

`param_value_size_ret`::

+
--

Returns the actual size in bytes of data copied to `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.

|Info.
returned in `param_value`

|`CL_KERNEL_MAX_SUB_- GROUP_SIZE_FOR_NDRANGE`
|size_t *
|size_t
|

Returns the maximum sub-group size for this kernel.
All subgroups must be the same size, while the last sub-group in any work-group (i.e.
the sub-group with the maximum index) could be the same or smaller size.

The `input_value` must be an array of `size_t` values corresponding to the local work size parameter of the intended dispatch.
The number of dimensions in the ND-range will be inferred from the value specified for `input_value_size`.

|`CL_KERNEL_SUB_GROUP_- COUNT_FOR_NDRANGE`
|size_t *
|size_t
|

Returns the number of sub-groups that will be present in each work-group for a given local work size.
All workgroups, apart from the last work-group in each dimension in the presence of non-uniform work-group sizes, will have the same number of subgroups.

The `input_value` must be an array of `size_t` values corresponding to the local work size parameter of the intended dispatch.
The number of dimensions in the ND-range will be inferred from the value specified for `input_value_size`.

|`CL_KERNEL_LOCAL_SIZE_ FOR_SUB_GROUP_COUNT`
|size_t
|size_t []
|

Returns the local size that will generate the requested number of sub- groups for the kernel.
The output array must be an array of `size_t` values corresponding to the local size parameter.
Any returned work-group will have one dimension.
Other dimensions inferred from the value specified for `param_value_size` will be filled with the value 1.
The returned value will produce an exact number of sub-groups and result in no partial groups for an executing kernel except in the case where the last work- group in a dimension has a size different from that of the other groups.
If no work-group size can accommodate the requested number of sub-groups, 0 will be returned in each element of the return array.

|`CL_KERNEL_MAX_NUM_SUB_GROUPS`
|ignored
|size_t
|This provides a mechanism for the application to query the maximum number of sub-groups that may make up each work-group to execute a kernel on a specific device given by device.
The OpenCL implementation uses the resource requirements of the kernel (register usage etc.) to determine what this work-group size should be.
The returned value may be used to compute a work-group size to enqueue the kernel with to give a round number of sub-groups for an enqueue.

|`CL_KERNEL_COMPILE_NUM_SUB_GROUPS`
|ignored
|size_t
|Returns the number of sub-groups specified in the kernel source or IL.
If the sub-group count is not specified using the above attribute then 0 is returned.

[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_DEVICE` if `device` is not in the list of devices associated with `kernel` or if `device` is NULL but there is more than one device associated with `kernel`.

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is < size of return type as described in the table above and `param_value` is not NULL.

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is `CL_KERNEL_SUB_GROUP_SIZE_FOR_NDRANGE` and the size in bytes specified by `input_value_size` is not valid or if `input_value` is NULL.

* `CL_INVALID_KERNEL` if `kernel` is a not a valid kernel object.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
