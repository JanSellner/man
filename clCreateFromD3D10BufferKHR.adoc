[[clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR]]
= clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR

Creates an OpenCL buffer object from a Direct3D 10 buffer.

[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`context`::

A valid OpenCL context created from a Direct3D 10 device.

`flags`::

A bit-field that is used to specify usage information.
May be `CL_MEM_READ_ONLY`, `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY`, or `CL_MEM_READ_WRITE`. (See the table for <<clCreateBuffer.adoc#, `clCreateBuffer`>> for more information.)

`resource`::

A pointer to the Direct3D 10 buffer to share.

`errcode_ret`::

An appropriate error code.
If `errcode_ret` is NULL, no error code is returned.


[[notes]]
== Notes

The size of the returned OpenCL buffer object is the same as the size of `resource`.
This call will increment the internal Direct3D reference count on `resource`.
The internal Direct3D reference count on `resource` will be decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL memory object drops to zero.

[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns a valid non-zero OpenCL buffer object and `errcode_ret` is set to `CL_SUCCESS` if the buffer object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a NULL value with one of the following error values returned in `errcode_ret`:

* `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if `context` is not a valid context.

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if values specified in `flags` are not valid.

* `CL_INVALID_D3D10_RESOURCE_KHR` if `resource` is not a Direct3D 10 buffer resource, if `resource` was created with the `D3D10_USAGE` flag `D3D10_USAGE_IMMUTABLE`, if a `cl_mem` from `resource` has already been created using `clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR`, or if `context` was not created against the same Direct3D 10 device from which `resource` was created.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
