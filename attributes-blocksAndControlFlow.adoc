Attributes of Blocks and Control-Flow Statements.

----
__attribute__((attr1)) {...}
----


[[description]]
== Description

For basic blocks and control-flow-statements the attribute is placed before the structure in question, for example:

----
    __attribute__((attr1)) {...}
    for __attribute__((attr2)) (...) __attribute__((attr3)) {...}
----

Here `attr1` applies to the block in braces and `attr2` and `attr3` apply to the loop's control construct and body, respectively.

No attribute qualifiers for blocks and control-flow-statements are currently defined.
