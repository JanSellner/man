[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`pipe`::

Specifies the pipe object being queried.

`param_name`::

+
--

Specifies the information to query.
The list of supported `param_name` types and the information returned in `param_value` by `clGetPipeInfo` is described in the table below.

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|cl_pipe_info
|Return Type
|Info.
returned in `param_value`

|`CL_PIPE_PACKET_SIZE`
|cl_uint
|Return pipe packet size specified when `pipe` is created with <<clCreatePipe.adoc#, `clCreatePipe`>>.

|`CL_PIPE_MAX_PACKETS`
|cl_uint
|Return max.
number of packets specified when `pipe` is created with <<clCreatePipe.adoc#, `clCreatePipe`>>.

|===

`param_value`::

A pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned.
If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`::

Used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size must be â‰¥ size of return type as described in the table above.

`param_value_size_ret`::

Returns the actual size in bytes of data being queried by `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.


[[description]]
== Notes

To get information that is common to all memory objects, use the <<clGetMemObjectInfo.adoc#, `clGetMemObjectInfo`>> function.


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is < the size of return type as described in the table above and `param_value` is not NULL.

* `CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT` if `pipe` is a not a valid memory object.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
