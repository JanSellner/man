|Constant Name
|Description

|MAXFLOAT
|Value of maximum non-infinite single-precision floating-point number.

|HUGE_VALF
|A positive float constant expression.
`HUGE_VALF` evaluates to +infinity.
Used as an error value returned by the <<mathFunctions.adoc#, built-in math functions>>.

|INFINITY
|A constant expression of type `float` representing positive or unsigned infinity.

|NAN
|A constant expression of type `float` representing a quiet NaN.
