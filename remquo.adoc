[[description]]
== Description

The `remquo` function computes the value `r` such that `r` = `x` - `k`*`y`, where `k` is the integer nearest the exact value of `x`/`y`.
If there are two integers closest to `x`/`y`, `k` shall be the even one.
If `r` is zero, it is given the same sign as `x`.
This is the same value that is returned by the <<remainder.adoc#, `remainder`>> function.

`remquo` also calculates the lower seven bits of the integral quotient `x`/`y`, and gives that value the same sign as `x`/`y`.
It stores this signed value in the object pointed to by `quo`.
