[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`source_kernel`::

A valid `cl_kernel` object that will be copied.
`source_kernel` will not be modified in any way by this function.

`errcode_ret`::

Assigned an appropriate error code.
If `errcode_ret` is `NULL`, no error code is returned.


[[description]]
== Description

Makes a shallow copy of the kernel object, its arguments and any information passed to the kernel object using <<clSetKernelExecInfo.adoc#, `clSetKernelExecInfo`>>.
If the kernel object was ready to be enqueued before copying it, the clone of the kernel object is ready to enqueue.


[[notes]]
== Notes

The returned kernel object is an exact copy of `source_kernel`, with one caveat: the reference count on the returned kernel object is set as if it had been returned by <<clCreateKernel.adoc#, `clCreateKernel`>> . The reference count of `source_kernel` will not be changed.

The resulting kernel will be in the same state as if <<clCreateKernel.adoc#, `clCreateKernel`>> is called to create the resultant kernel with the same arguments as those used to create `source_kernel`, the latest call to <<clSetKernelArg.adoc#, `clSetKernelArg`>> or <<clSetKernelArgSVMPointer.adoc#, `clSetKernelArgSVMPointer`>> for each argument index applied to kernel and the last call to <<clSetKernelExecInfo.adoc#, `clSetKernelExecInfo`>> for each value of the param name parameter are applied to the new kernel object.

All arguments of the new kernel object must be intact and it may be correctly used in the same situations as kernel except those that assume a pre-existing reference count.
Setting arguments on the new kernel object will not affect `source_kernel` except insofar as the argument points to a shared underlying entity and in that situation behavior is as if two kernel objects had been created and the same argument applied to each.
Only the data stored in the kernel object is copied; data referenced by the kernelâ€™s arguments are not copied.
For example, if a buffer or pointer argument is set on a kernel object, the pointer is copied but the underlying memory allocation is not.


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns a valid non-zero kernel object and `errcode_ret` is set to `CL_SUCCESS` if the kernel is successfully copied.
Otherwise it returns a NULL value with one of the following error values returned in `errcode_ret`:

* `CL_INVALID_KERNEL` if `kernel` is not a valid kernel object.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host
