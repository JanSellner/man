<div class="title">Synchronizing OpenCL and OpenGL Access</div>
<p>In order to ensure data integrity, the application is responsible for synchronizing access to shared CL/GL objects by their respective APIs.
Failure to provide such synchronization may result in race conditions and other undefined behavior including non-portability between implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prior to calling <code>clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects</code>, the application must ensure that any pending GL operations which access the objects specified in <code>mem_objects</code> have completed.
This may be accomplished portably by issuing and waiting for completion of a <code>glFinish</code> command on all GL contexts with pending references to these objects.
Implementations may offer more efficient synchronization methods; for example on some platforms calling <code>glFlush</code> may be sufficient, or synchronization may be implicit within a thread, or there may be vendor-specific extensions that enable placing a fence in the GL command stream and waiting for completion of that fence in the CL command queue.
Note that no synchronization methods other than <code>glFinish</code> are portable between OpenGL implementations at this time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the extension <a href="cl_khr_egl_event.html"><code>cl_khr_egl_event</code></a> is supported: Prior to calling <code>clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects</code>, the application must ensure that any pending EGL or EGL client API operations which access the objects specified in <code>mem_objects</code> have completed.
If the <a href="cl_khr_egl_event.html"><code>cl_khr_egl_event</code></a> extension is supported and the EGL context in question supports fence sync objects, <em>explicit synchronisation</em> can be achieved as set out in section 5.7.1.
If the <a href="cl_khr_egl_event.html"><code>cl_khr_egl_event</code></a> extension is not supported, completion of EGL client API commands may be determined by issuing and waiting for completion of commands such as <code>glFinish</code> or <code>vgFinish</code> on all client API contexts with pending references to these objects.
Some implementations may offer other efficient synchronization methods.
If such methods exist they will be described in platform-specific documentation.
Note that no synchronization methods other than <code>glFinish</code> and <code>vgFinish</code> are portable between all EGL client API implementations and all OpenCL implementations.
While this is the only way to ensure completion that is portable to all platforms, these are expensive operation and their use should be avoided if the <a href="cl_khr_egl_event.html"><code>cl_khr_egl_event</code></a> extension is supported on a platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, after calling <code>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</code>, the application is responsible for ensuring that any pending OpenCL operations which access the objects specified in <code>mem_objects</code> have completed prior to executing subsequent GL commands which reference these objects.
This may be accomplished portably by calling <a href="clWaitForEvents.html"><code>clWaitForEvents</code></a> with the event object returned by <code>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</code>, or by calling <a href="clFinish.html"><code>clFinish</code></a>.
As above, some implementations may offer more efficient methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application is responsible for maintaining the proper order of operations if the CL and GL contexts are in separate threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a GL context is bound to a thread other than the one in which <code>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</code> is called, changes to any of the objects in <code>mem_objects</code> may not be visible to that context without additional steps being taken by the application.
For an OpenGL 3.1 (or later) context, the requirements are described in Appendix D ("Shared Objects and Multiple Contexts") of the OpenGL 3.1 Specification.
For prior versions of OpenGL, the requirements are implementation-dependent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attempting to access the data store of an OpenGL object after it has been acquired by OpenCL and before it has been released will result in undefined behavior.
Similarly, attempting to access a shared CL/GL object from OpenCL before it has been acquired by the OpenCL command queue, or after it has been released, will result in undefined behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <a href="cl_khr_gl_event.html"><code>cl_khr_gl_event</code></a> extension is supported, then the OpenCL implementation will ensure that any such pending OpenGL operations are complete for an OpenGL context bound to the same thread as the OpenCL context.
This is referred to as implicit synchronization.</p>
