== Description

The diagram above represents the OpenCL specification as a class diagram using the Unified Modeling Language* (UML) notation.
The diagram shows both nodes and edges which are classes and their relationships.
As a simplification it shows only classes, and no attributes or operations.
As for relationships it shows aggregations (annotated with a solid diamond), associations (no annotation), and inheritance (annotated with an open arrowhead).
The cardinality of a relationship is shown on each end of it.
A cardinality of "*" represents "many", a cardinality of "1" represents "one and only one" and a cardinality of "0:1" represents "optionally one".
The navigability of a relationship is shown using a regular arrowhead.
