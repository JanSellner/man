== Description

For the form without `reserve_id`, write packet specified by `ptr` into pipe `p`.
Returns 0 if `write_pipe` is successful and a negative value if the pipe is full.

For the form using `reserve_id`, write packet specified by `ptr` to the reserved area of the pipe referred to by `reserve_id` and `index`.
The reserved pipe entries are referred to by indices that go from 0 … `num_packets` – 1.
Returns 0 if `write_pipe` is successful and a negative value otherwise.
