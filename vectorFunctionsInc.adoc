Vector Data Load and Store Functions allow you to read and write vector types from a pointer to memory.

The suffix `n` in the function names (i.e.
vload`n`, vstore`n` etc.) represent `n`-element vectors, where `n` = 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16.

The results of vector data load and store functions are undefined if the address being read from or written to is not correctly aligned.
The pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to <<global.adoc#, `global`>>, <<local.adoc#, `local`>>, or <<private.adoc#, `private`>> memory for store functions.
The pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to global, local, constant or private memory for load functions.

NOTE: The vector data load and store functions variants that take pointer arguments which point to the generic address space are also supported.
