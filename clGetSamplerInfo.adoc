[[parameters]]
== Parameters

`sampler`::

Specifies the sampler being queried.

`param_name`::

+
--

Specifies the information to query.
The list of supported `param_name` types and the information returned in `param_value` by `clGetSamplerInfo` is described in the table below.

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===

|cl_sampler_info
|Return Type and Info.
returned in `param_value`

|`CL_SAMPLER_REFERENCE_COUNT`
|Return type: cl_uint

Return the `sampler` reference count.
The reference count returned should be considered immediately stale.
It is unsuitable for general use in applications.
This feature is provided for identifying memory leaks.

|`CL_SAMPLER_CONTEXT`
|Return type: cl_context

Return the context specified when the sampler is created.

|`CL_SAMPLER_NORMALIZED_COORDS`
|Return type: cl_bool

Return the normalized coords value associated with `sampler`.

|`CL_SAMPLER_ADDRESSING_MODE`
|Return type: cl_addressing_mode

Return the addressing mode value associated with `sampler`.

|`CL_SAMPLER_FILTER_MODE`
|Return type: cl_filter_mode

Return the filter mode value associated with `sampler`.

|===

--

`param_value`::

A pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is returned.
If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`::

Specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size must be â‰¥ size of return type as described in the table above.

`param_value_size_ret`::

Returns the actual size in bytes of data copied to `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.


[[errors]]
== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is < size of return type as described in the table above and `param_value` is not NULL

* `CL_INVALID_SAMPLER` if `sampler` is a not a valid sampler object.

* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
