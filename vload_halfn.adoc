[[vload_halfn]]
= vload_halfn

Read a half float vector from a pointer to memory.

[source,c]
----
float n vload_half n(size_t offset,
                     const half *p)

float n vload_half n(size_t offset,
                     const constant half *p)

[[description]]
== Description

Read sizeof(`halfn`) bytes of data from address (`p` + (`offset` * `n`)).
The data read is interpreted as a `halfn` value.

The `halfn` value read is converted to a `floatn` value and the `floatn` value is returned.
The read address computed as (`p` + (`offset` * `n`)) must be 16-bit aligned.

== Notes

include::vectorFunctionsInc.adoc[]

We use the type name `halfn` to represent n-element vectors of `half` elements.

When extended by the <<cl_khr_fp16.adoc#, `cl_khr_fp16`>> extension, the generic type `gentypen` is extended to include `half`, `half2`, `half3`, `half4`, `half8`, and `half16`.

`vload3` and `vload_half3` read `x`, `y`, `z` components from address (`p` + (`offset` * 3)) into a 3-component vector.
