These all operate component-wise.
The description is per-component.
The generic type name `gentype` is used to indicate that the function can take `float`, `float2`, `float3`, `float4`, `float8`, `float16`, `double`, `double2`, `double3`, `double4`, `double8`, or `double16` as the type for the arguments.

The generic type name `gentypef` is used to indicate that the function can take `float`, `float2`, `float3`, `float4`, `float8`, or `float16` as the type for the arguments.

The generic type name `gentyped` is used to indicate that the function can take `double`, `double2`, `double3`, `double4`, `double8`, or `double16` as the type for the arguments.

The built-in common functions are implemented using the round to nearest even rounding mode.
