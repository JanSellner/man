|An OpenCL device that is the host processor.
The host processor runs the OpenCL implementations and is a single or multi-core CPU.

These devices communicate with the host processor using a peripheral interconnect such as PCIe.

|`CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CUSTOM`
|Dedicated accelerators that do not support programs written in OpenCL C.

|`CL_DEVICE_TYPE_DEFAULT`
|The default OpenCL device in the system.
The default device cannot be a `CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CUSTOM` device.

|`CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL`
|All OpenCL devices available in the system except `CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CUSTOM` devices.
