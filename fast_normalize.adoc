[[fast_normalize]]
= fast_normalize

Normal vector length 1.

[source,c]
----
float n fast_normalize(float n p)

[[description]]
== Description

Returns a vector in the same direction as `p` but with a length of 1.
`fast_normalize` is computed as:

----
          p * half_rsqrt(p.x2 + p.y2 +...)
----

The result shall be within 8192 ulps error from the infinitely precise result of:

----
          if (all(p == 0.0f))
                    result = p;
          else
                    result = p /  sqrt(p.x2 + p.y2 +...);
----

with the following exceptions:

. If the sum of squares is greater than `FLT_MAX` then the value of the floating-point values in the result vector are undefined.

. If the sum of squares is less than `FLT_MIN` then the implementation may return back `p`.

. If the device is in 'denorms are flushed to zero' mode, individual operand elements with magnitude less than <<sqrt.adoc#, `sqrt`>>(`FLT_MIN`) may be flushed to zero before proceeding with the calculation.
