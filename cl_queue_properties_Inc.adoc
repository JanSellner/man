|`CL_QUEUE_PROPERTIES`
|`cl_command_queue_- properties`
|

This is a bitfield and can be set to a combination of the following values:

`CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE` - Determines whether the commands queued in the command-queue are executed in-order or out-of-order.
If set, the commands in the command-queue are executed out-of-order.
Otherwise, commands are executed in-order.

`CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE` - Enable or disable profiling of commands in the command-queue.
If set, the profiling of commands is enabled.
Otherwise profiling of commands is disabled.

`CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE` - Indicates that this is a device queue.
If `CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE` is set, `CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE` must also be set.
Only out-of-order device queues are supported.

`CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE_DEFAULT` - indicates that this is the default device queue.
This can only be used with `CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE`.
The application must create the default device queue if any kernels containing calls to get_default_queue are enqueued.
There can only be one default device queue for each device within a context.
clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties with `CL_QUEUE_PROPERTIES` set to `CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE` \| `CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE_DEFAULT` will return the default device queue that has already been created and increment its retain count by 1.

If `CL_QUEUE_PROPERTIES` is not specified an in-order host command queue is created for the specified device.

|`CL_QUEUE_SIZE`
|`cl_uint`
|

Specifies the size of the device queue in bytes.

This can only be specified if `CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE` is set in `CL_QUEUE_PROPERTIES`.
This must be a value ≤ `CL_DEVICE_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE_MAX_SIZE`.

For best performance, this should be ≤ `CL_DEVICE_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE_PREFERRED_SIZE`.

If `CL_QUEUE_SIZE` is not specified, the device queue is created with `CL_DEVICE_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE_PREFERRED_SIZE` as the size of the queue.

|`CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_KHR`
|`cl_queue_priority_khr`
|

Applies only if the <<cl_khr_priority_hints.adoc#, `cl_khr_priority_hints`>> extension is enabled.

Can be one of `CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH_KHR`, `CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_MED_KHR`, or `CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW_KHR`.

If `CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_KHR` is not specified then the default priority is `CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_MED_KHR`.

|`CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_KHR`
|
|

Applies only if the <<cl_khr_throttle_hints.adoc#, `cl_khr_throttle_hints`>> extension is enabled.

Can be one of `CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_HIGH_KHR`, `CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_MED_KHR`, `CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_LOW_KHR`

If `CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_KHR` is not specified then the default priority is `CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_MED_KHR`.
