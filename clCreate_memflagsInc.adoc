|cl_mem_flags
|Description

|`CL_MEM_READ_WRITE`
|This flag specifies that the memory object will be read and written by a kernel.
This is the default.

|`CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY`
|

This flag specifies that the memory object will be written but not read by a kernel.

Reading from a buffer or image object created with `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY` inside a kernel is undefined.

`CL_MEM_READ_WRITE` and `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY` are mutually exclusive.

|`CL_MEM_READ_ONLY`
|

This flag specifies that the memory object is a read-only memory object when used inside a kernel.

Writing to a buffer or image object created with `CL_MEM_READ_ONLY` inside a kernel is undefined.

`CL_MEM_READ_WRITE` or `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY` and `CL_MEM_READ_ONLY` are mutually exclusive.

|`CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR`
|

This flag is valid only if `host_ptr` is not NULL.
If specified, it indicates that the application wants the OpenCL implementation to use memory referenced by `host_ptr` as the storage bits for the memory object.

OpenCL implementations are allowed to cache the buffer contents pointed to by `host_ptr` in device memory.
This cached copy can be used when kernels are executed on a device.

The result of OpenCL commands that operate on multiple buffer objects created with the same `host_ptr` or overlapping host regions is considered to be undefined.

|`CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR`
|

This flag specifies that the application wants the OpenCL implementation to allocate memory from host accessible memory.

`CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR` and `CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR` are mutually exclusive.

|`CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR`
|

This flag is valid only if `host_ptr` is not NULL.
If specified, it indicates that the application wants the OpenCL implementation to allocate memory for the memory object and copy the data from memory referenced by `host_ptr`.

`CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR` and `CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR` are mutually exclusive.

`CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR` can be used with `CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR` to initialize the contents of the `cl_mem` object allocated using host-accessible (e.g.
PCIe) memory.

|`CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY`
|

This flag specifies that the host will only write to the memory object (using OpenCL APIs that enqueue a write or a map for write).
This can be used to optimize write access from the host (e.g.
enable write-combined allocations for memory objects for devices that communicate with the host over a system bus such as PCIe).

|`CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY`
|

This flag specifies that the host will only read the memory object (using OpenCL APIs that enqueue a read or a map for read).

`CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY` and `CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY` are mutually exclusive.

|`CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS`
|

This flag specifies that the host will not read or write the memory object.

`CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY` or `CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY` and `CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS` are mutually exclusive.
