[[description]]
== Description

Broadcast the value of `x` for work-item identified by `local_id` to all work-items in the work-group.

`local_id` must be the same value for all work-items in the work-group.

This built-in function must be encountered by all work-items in a work-group executing the kernel.
We use the generic type name gentype to indicate the built-in data types half (if the <<cl_khr_fp16.adoc#, `cl_khr_fp16`>> extension is supported), int, uint, long, ulong, float or double (if double precision is supported) as the type for the arguments.
