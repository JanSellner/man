[[description]]
== Description

`mul24` multiplies two 24-bit integer values `x` and `y`.
`x` and `y` are 32-bit integers but only the low 24-bits are used to perform the multiplication.
`mul24` should only be used when values in `x` and `y` are in the range [-2^23^, 2^23^-1] if `x` and `y` are signed integers and in the range [0, 2^24^-1] if `x` and `y` are unsigned integers.
If `x` and `y` are not in this range, the multiplication result is implementation-defined.


[[notes]]
== Notes

Fast integer functions can be used for optimizing performance of kernels.
We use the generic type name `gentype` to indicate that the function can take `int`, `int2`, `int3`, `int4`, `int8`, `int16`, `uint`, `uint2`, `uint3`, `uint4`, `uint8`, or `uint16` as the type for the arguments.
