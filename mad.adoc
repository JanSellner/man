[[description]]
== Description

`mad` approximates `a` * `b` + `c`.
Whether or how the product of `a` * `b` is rounded and how supernormal or subnormal intermediate products are handled is not defined.
`mad` is intended to be used where speed is preferred over accuracy.

For some usages, e.g.
`mad`(`a`, `b`, -`a`*`b`), the definition of `mad()` is loose enough that almost any result is allowed from `mad()` for some values of `a` and `b`.
