== Description

The `atomic_flag` type provides the classic test-and-set functionality.
It has two states, set (value is non-zero) and clear (value is 0).
Operations on an object of type `atomic_flag` shall be lock free.

The macro `ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT` may be used to initialize an `atomic_flag` to the clear state.
An `atomic_flag` that is not explicitly initialized with `ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT` is initially in an indeterminate state.

This macro can only be used for atomic objects that are declared in program scope in the global address space with the `atomic_flag` type.
