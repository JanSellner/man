[[description]]
== Description

Returns 0.0 if `x` ≤ `edge0` and 1.0 if `x` ≥ `edge1` and performs smooth Hermite interpolation between 0 and 1 when `edge0` < `x` < `edge1`.
This is useful in cases where you would want a threshold function with a smooth transition.

This is equivalent to:

----
          gentype t;
          t = clamp((x - edge0) / (edge1 - edge0), 0, 1);
          return t * t * (3 - 2 * t);
----

For the forms that take an `edge0` of type other than `half` or `halfn`, results are undefined if `edge0` ≥ `edge1` or if `x`, `edge0` or `edge1` is a NaN.
For the forms that are enabled with the <<cl_khr_fp16.adoc#, `cl_khr_fp16`>> extension, results are undefined if `edge0` ≥ `edge1`.

== Notes

include::commonFunctionsInc.adoc[]

If extended with <<cl_khr_fp16.adoc#, `cl_khr_fp16`>>, generic type name `gentype` may indicate `half` and `half{2|3|4|8|16}` as arguments and return values.

The mix and smoothstep functions can be implemented using contractions such as <<mad.adoc#, `mad`>> or <<fma.adoc#, `fma`>>.
